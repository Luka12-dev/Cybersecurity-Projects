How to Use Stealth Port Scanner – Complete Guide
What is a Stealth Port Scanner?
A Stealth Port Scanner is a specialized network tool designed to scan target machines for open ports without being easily detected by security systems such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS). Unlike regular scanners that openly connect to ports, stealth scanners use techniques to minimize traceability and avoid triggering alarms.

Why Use a Stealth Port Scanner?
Bypass security monitoring: It helps to scan networks without raising suspicion.

Perform covert network reconnaissance: Essential for penetration testers and ethical hackers to map target systems quietly.

Identify vulnerable services: Detect open ports that could be exploited without alerting defenders.

How to Use This Stealth Port Scanner
Open the Stealth Port Scanner application.

Enter the target IP address or hostname of the system you want to scan.

Set the port range to scan (e.g., from 1 to 65535). Adjust the range based on how thorough you want the scan to be.

Configure stealth options (if available):

Use slow scan speed to avoid detection.

Randomize scanning order.

Use fragmented packets or other evasion techniques.

Start the scan by clicking the “Start Scan” button.

Monitor the output to see which ports are open, closed, or filtered silently.
